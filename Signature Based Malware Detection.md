# Signature Based Malware Detection

Known malware files can be identified through predetermined patterns or signatures. For example, my script recognizes that the names of the malware files, which look like this: `0d964caf-265c-419a-b779-dbe43c8a6b4a.sh`, follow this pattern. This isolates the malware files from my normal system files and allows my antimalware program to eliminate them from my system. A regex command like this can be used to identify this signature.

```regex
^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}\.sh$
``````

# Behavior Based Malware Detection

This is a more proactive approach to malware detection because, rather than relying on a previously known signature, the program would look at new files and their functions and stop suspicious behavior. For example, if I had written my script to look at the new files and recognize that they are attempting to alter the apache2 server and stop it before it runs, that would be an example of behavior-based malware detection.

# Comparison and Advantages/Disadvantages

- **Signature Based Detection:**
  - *Advantages:*
    - Simpler to implement and can be widespread.
    - Once a company identifies a malware’s signature, they can share it and aid in others’ protection.
  - *Disadvantages:*
    - Limited to only known signatures; new malware or zero-day threats would not be detected.

- **Behavior Based Detection:**
  - *Advantages:*
    - More complicated but can identify new malware that has never been seen before.
  - *Disadvantages:*
    - Can be wrong since it has to preemptively determine the validity of a file, which could interrupt intentional processes.

The tradeoff between the two lies in the level of complexity and the ability to detect new and unknown threats. Signature-based detection is reliable for known threats but may miss new ones, while behavior-based detection is more proactive but can potentially lead to false positives and interruptions of legitimate processes.
